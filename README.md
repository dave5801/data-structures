# data-structures

# Binary Search Tree

    #This data structure has the property where left child node must be less than its parent,
    while its right child is greater. 

    #Since this informations is already organized time complexity will be O(logn)

    # insert - add new Tree Node to BST. 

    # search - Search left and rode nodes for matching values.

    # get_depth - recursively get depth of left and right nodes.

    # contains - returns true if node is in list

    # balance - return -1 if the tree is right heavy, 1 if it is left heavy, and 0 if the tree is balanced.

    # in_order : recursively sort in ascending order
